"""Safe vault IO chokepoint for agents.

This module is the *single* place agents go through to write vault notes.
It wraps the low-level primitives in ``core/notes.py`` with two guarantees:

1. **Path safety**: every path is validated to live inside the vault's
   ``threads/`` tree, not under ``.archive/``, and not equal to
   ``rules/prime.md``.
2. **Audit hook**: every mutation goes through ``atomic_write_text`` so the
   graph dirty-flag and watchdog observe the write the same way.

Agents don't call ``core/notes.py:atomic_write_text`` directly anymore;
they use ``vault_io.write_note(vault_root, path, meta, body)``. The wider
style-guide invariant ("agents don't write vault files directly") is then
a single import boundary you can grep for.

Notes:
- Reads (``parse_note``, scans) still hit the filesystem directly via the
  callers' existing helpers. Locking down reads gains little here and would
  multiply the diff. Writes are where correctness matters.
- The ``rules/`` and ``agents/`` subtrees are outside this module's scope —
  agents already touch their own ``memory.md`` and changelog through
  dedicated helpers; ``prime.md`` is forbidden at the BaseAgent layer.
