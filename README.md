## What is Loom?

Loom is a personal knowledge system that stores everything as **plain Markdown** on your disk and uses a **team of AI agents** to keep it organized. Notes connect via `[[wikilinks]]`, and a **force-directed graph** lets you see your mind at a glance.

You write captures; agents do the structuring, linking, summarizing, and validating. The whole stack runs locally — your files, your provider keys, your machine.

> **New here?** The [Getting Started guide](docs/getting-started.md) walks you from install through onboarding, the four views, and the capture → note → graph loop.

## Why Loom?

- **Local-first.** Notes live as readable Markdown in `~/.loom/vaults/`. No lock-in, no cloud sync, no proprietary database.
- **Multi-agent, not single-prompt.** Seven specialized agents in two tiers (Loom Layer manages the vault; Shuttle Layer produces content) — plus any custom agents you add — collaborate via a shared *read-before-write* discipline.
- **Visual by default.** A `Sigma.js` + `graphology` canvas shows your notes as a living network — drag, zoom, filter by type or tag.
- **Provider-agnostic.** Plug in OpenAI, Anthropic, xAI, OpenRouter, or a local Ollama model. Chat and embedding providers are independent, and every model call is recorded as an inspectable trace.

## Architecture at a glance

The backend reads and writes the vault on disk; the frontend renders it. The agent runner orchestrates AI calls; the file watcher keeps the index fresh when notes change outside the UI.

## The two-tier agent system

    User --> Direct
    Council --> LoomLayer
    Direct --> ShuttleLayer
    ShuttleLayer -- writes to --> Captures
    LoomLayer -- processes --> Captures
    LoomLayer -- maintains --> Vault
```

**Loom Layer** agents manage the vault. You speak to them collectively via the **Loom Council** — a transparent multi-agent thread where each one chimes in by role.

**Shuttle Layer** agents are task-driven; you chat with them one-on-one. They never write into the main vault — they drop output into `captures/`, and the Loom Layer takes it from there. You can also define your own custom Shuttle-tier agents from the Board; the seven built-ins below stay read-only.

### Agent reference

| Agent | Tier | Role |
|---|---|---|
| **Weaver** | Loom | Converts raw captures into structured notes with YAML frontmatter. |
| **Spider** | Loom | Finds semantic connections and maintains bidirectional `[[wikilinks]]`. |
| **Archivist** | Loom | Audits the vault — flags stale notes, broken links, missing metadata. |
| **Scribe** | Loom | Writes folder `_index.md` files and daily logs. |
| **Sentinel** | Loom | Validates every agent action against `prime.md` rules and schemas. |
| **Researcher** | Shuttle | Answers questions by searching the vault and citing source notes. |
| **Standup** | Shuttle | Generates a daily activity recap from changelogs and modified notes. |

## Read-before-write

Every agent follows the same chain before performing any mutation. This keeps the vault internally consistent and gives `prime.md` (your constitution) real authority.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    Trigger[Action triggered] --> R1[vault.yaml]
    R1 --> R2[rules/prime.md]
    R2 --> R3[agents/&lt;self&gt;/memory.md]
    R3 --> R4[target _index.md]
    R4 --> R5[related linked notes]
    R5 --> Check{Sentinel<br/>validates}
    Check -- pass --> Act[Write/edit/link]
    Check -- fail --> Block[Hard block or warn]
```

Hard block on failure by default; trusted agents can be configured for soft-warn.

## How it works

### From capture to note

A raw capture never becomes a note in one step. Weaver classifies and formats it, Sentinel validates the result against `prime.md` and the matching schema, the note is written to disk, and Spider connects it to the rest of the vault. The inbox lets you `preview` this whole chain as a dry run before you `commit`.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    actor User
    participant Inbox as Captures inbox
    participant Weaver
    participant Sentinel
    participant Vault as Markdown vault
    participant Spider

    User->>Inbox: Drop a raw capture
    Inbox->>Weaver: Process (or dry-run preview)
    Weaver->>Weaver: Classify type, tags, folder
    Weaver->>Sentinel: Validate vs prime.md + schema
    Sentinel-->>Weaver: Pass / flag
    Weaver->>Vault: Write structured note
    Vault->>Spider: New note to connect
    Spider->>Vault: Add [[wikilinks]] to related notes
    Spider-->>User: Filed and linked
```

### Council chat, streamed

When you ask the Loom Council a question, the backend fans the prompt out to all five system agents (capped at three concurrent calls so a single turn doesn't blow a free model's rate limit). Each agent's take arrives as one `contributions` event, then an aggregator distils them into a single voice that streams back token by token over Server-Sent Events. The final `done` frame carries a `trace_id` so you can open the raw model call.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    actor User
    participant API as POST /api/chat/send/stream
    participant Council as Loom Council
    participant Agents as 5 Loom agents
    participant LLM as Chat provider

    User->>API: Ask the Council
    API->>Council: Open SSE stream
    Council->>Agents: Fan out (≤3 concurrent)
    Agents->>LLM: One call per agent
    LLM-->>Agents: Per-agent answer

    Council->>LLM: Aggregate into one voice
    LLM-->>Council: Token stream
    Council-->>User: event: token (repeated)
    Council-->>User: event: done (+ trace_id)
```

### Providers, and every call traced

All five providers sit behind one registry. Chat and embedding providers are resolved independently, and every provider is wrapped in a `TracedProvider` that records each exchange — provider, model, messages, response, duration — into a 500-entry in-memory ring that also mirrors to disk by date. The "raw call" link anywhere in the UI reads straight from `/api/traces`.

```mermaid

```

### Hybrid search

Search blends three signals: semantic similarity from LanceDB vectors, plain keyword matching with tag/type filters, and a graph-aware boost that lifts notes already linked to strong hits. When no embedding provider is configured, it degrades gracefully to keyword-only.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    Q[Search query]

    end

    R[Results]

## Features

### Knowledge graph
- Force-directed Sigma.js 3 + graphology layout with drag, zoom, pan
- Orbit mode: focus-first concentric rings around a selected node (rings / spiral / arms scenes)
- Edge travelers: little dashes animate along edges so the graph reads as alive, not static
- Display panel: tune label size & density, node size, spacing, edge thickness, breathing, and travelers — persisted to `localStorage` with one-click reset
- Hover highlights neighbors; edge thickness scales with link density
- Filter by note type or tag; click-to-select syncs with the file tree
- ETags + `Last-Modified` for cheap refresh

### Vault & notes
- Multi-vault filesystem at `~/.loom/vaults/`
- Fixed core folders (`daily`, `projects`, `topics`, `people`, `captures`) plus your own
- Atomic Markdown writes with YAML frontmatter (`id`, `title`, `type`, `tags`, `created`, `modified`, `author`, `status`, `history`)
- Edit history tracked per-mutation in frontmatter
- Deletion = move to `.archive/`, never destroyed
- File watcher reflects external edits live

### Search
- Hybrid: semantic (LanceDB vectors) + keyword + tag/type filters
- Graph-aware boosting — linked notes rank higher
- Keyword fallback when no embedding provider is configured
- Global search bar (Cmd/Ctrl+K) plus a separate file-tree filter

### Agents & chat
- Loom Council chat streams its answer token-by-token over SSE, with each agent's contribution shown as its own bubble
- Every model call is captured as a trace — open the "raw call" on any message to see provider, model, prompt, response, and latency
- Custom agents: spin up your own Shuttle-tier agent from the Board; the seven built-in agents stay read-only
- Per-agent `memory.md` summarized every 20 actions
- Per-agent-per-day changelog at `.loom/changelog/<agent>/<date>.md`
- Chat history persisted as Markdown: `agents/_council/chat/` for Council, `agents/<name>/chat/` for Shuttle
- Captures inbox view for triaging raw input before Weaver structures it

### Providers
- OpenAI (chat + embed)
- Anthropic (chat)
- xAI / Grok (chat)
- OpenRouter (chat — including `:free` models, with rate-limit-aware retries)
- Ollama (local chat + embed)
- Chat and embedding providers configured independently

### Onboarding wizard
- First-run multi-step flow: Welcome → Vault Setup → Theme Picker → Provider Config
- Live theme previews (Paper, Navy, Forest, Sepia) before commit
- Inline "Test connection" against the picked provider — failures don't block save
- Skip-friendly: provider step is optional, defaults pick safe models
- Onboarding state lives in `~/.loom/config.yaml` under `onboarding.completed`

## Quick start

### Run with Docker (one command)

The fastest way to try Loom. Builds the frontend and backend into a single
container that serves both on **one port**.

```bash
cp .env.example .env     # optional — add a provider key, or skip and use onboarding
docker compose up        # first build takes a few minutes
```

Then open **http://localhost:8000**. The onboarding wizard handles vault and
provider setup on first run.

Your notes persist in the `loom-data` Docker volume across restarts and
rebuilds. To keep them as plain Markdown files on your machine instead, swap the
volume for a bind mount (see the commented line in `docker-compose.yml`).

> **Note:** Provider API keys are stored in plain text (in `.env` and in the
> vault's `config.yaml`). Keep `.env` private — it is git-ignored by default.
>
> **Security:** the published port binds to `127.0.0.1` (this machine only) and the
> API ships **no auth**. Do not expose it to a LAN/internet without a reverse proxy
> + auth — see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

### Run from source (for development)

#### Prerequisites
- Python ≥ 3.11
- Node.js ≥ 18 with npm
- An API key for at least one provider (or a running Ollama instance)

#### Backend
```bash
cd backend
pip install -e ".[dev]" --break-system-packages
uvicorn api.main:app --reload --port 8000
```

#### Frontend
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev   # serves on http://localhost:5173
```

On first run the **onboarding wizard** walks you through vault name, theme, and provider setup. The provider step is optional and can be added later from the in-app **Settings → Providers** panel (or by editing `~/.loom/config.yaml` directly). The backend reads `~/.loom/config.yaml` for global config and scaffolds a vault at `~/.loom/vaults/<name>` when the wizard completes.

### Seed an example vault
```bash
# Copy the demo vault to your local Loom directory
cp -r examples/demo-vault ~/.loom/vaults/demo
```

Then switch to it via `PUT /api/vaults/active` with `{"name": "demo"}` (or re-run the onboarding wizard with `demo` as the vault name).

## Configuration

Global config lives at `~/.loom/config.yaml`:

```yaml
active_vault: default
providers:
  default: openai
  openai:
    api_key: ${OPENAI_API_KEY}
    embed_model: text-embedding-3-small
    chat_model: gpt-4o
  anthropic:
    api_key: ${ANTHROPIC_API_KEY}
    chat_model: claude-sonnet-4-20250514
  xai:
    api_key: ${XAI_API_KEY}
    chat_model: grok-3
  openrouter:
    api_key: ${OPENROUTER_API_KEY}
    chat_model: qwen/qwen3-next-80b-a3b-instruct:free
  ollama:
    host: http://localhost:11434
    embed_model: nomic-embed-text
    chat_model: llama3
```

Per-vault config lives at `~/.loom/vaults/<name>/vault.yaml` (custom folders, agent overrides, etc).

## Status

**Open beta (0.4.0).** Loom runs end-to-end and is stable for daily local use; it
is not yet a hardened, internet-exposable 1.0 (see *Known gaps*). What works today:

- All 5 Loom Layer agents (Weaver, Spider, Archivist, Scribe, Sentinel) with the read-before-write chain
- Both Shuttle Layer agents (Researcher, Standup) plus user-defined custom agents
- Graph, Board, Inbox, and Thread views
- First-run onboarding wizard (vault, theme, provider)
- Settings UI — appearance, providers (with key validation), vault, about/diagnostics, danger zone
- Streaming Loom Council chat with per-call trace inspection
- Multi-vault management
- Hybrid semantic + keyword search with graph-aware boosting
- Provider system (OpenAI, Anthropic, xAI, OpenRouter, Ollama)
- File watcher, rate limiting, health/readiness probes
- One-command Docker run (single container serves UI + API)

**Resilience & correctness** (the focus of recent work):
- Bounded provider retry (backoff + jitter) at the trace chokepoint — a transient blip no longer fails a whole search or index pass (OpenRouter keeps its own 429 loop)
- Index-drift detection: notes that land in the metadata index but miss the vector store are reconciled on startup, surfaced via `/api/health`, and shown as a "rebuilding" banner
- Idempotent capture pipeline — a crash between note-write and archive can't create a duplicate on retry
- Token-based prompt truncation (`tiktoken`, char-count fallback) so a dense note can't silently blow the context window
- A true end-to-end pipeline test (capture → Weaver → index → search), plus failure-path coverage for the providers/onboarding/SSE/agent routes
- Boot-screen timeout with a Retry fallback instead of an infinite spinner; accessible confirm dialogs in place of `window.confirm`

**In flight:**
- Scribe's daily-log generation works; the summary phrasing is still being tuned
- Sentinel's AI-assisted validation works (LLM path with a deterministic fallback); rule coverage is being broadened
- Standup `generate()` works; no external calendar link yet

**Known gaps (the road to 1.0):**
- **No auth layer.** Safe on localhost; do not expose the port to a LAN/internet without your own reverse proxy + auth — see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md)
- **Provider API keys are stored in plain text** in `config.yaml` — no encryption or OS-keychain support yet
- `AppContext` still hosts most global frontend state (one large provider); a few Board child components and the `useGraph*` hooks remain untested (backend and the rest of the frontend are well covered)

See [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for the full design (and [`docs/architecture-ref.md`](docs/architecture-ref.md) for the condensed version), and [`docs/style-guide.md`](docs/style-guide.md) for conventions.
