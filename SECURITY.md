# Security Policy

Loom is **local-first, single-user software**. Its threat model assumes it runs on
a machine you control, reachable only by you. Read this before exposing it to a
network.

## Threat model & supported deployment

- **Supported:** running Loom on `localhost` — `npm run dev` / `uvicorn` during
  development, or `docker compose up` (which binds the published port to
  `127.0.0.1` by default).
- **Not supported:** exposing the API to a LAN or the internet **without** a
  reverse proxy that adds authentication and TLS. The API has **no auth layer**
  of its own.

If you bind the port beyond loopback (e.g. `0.0.0.0:8000` in `docker-compose.yml`,
or a `-p 8000:8000` Docker run), anyone who can reach that address can read,
create, edit, and archive **every note in your vault** and read your provider
configuration. Rate limiting (slowapi) is the only speed bump, and it is not an
access control. Do not do this on an untrusted network.

To expose Loom intentionally, put it behind something like nginx/Caddy/Traefik
with auth + TLS, and only then change the compose port binding.

## Known limitations (intentional for v1, documented)

- **No API authentication.** Safe on localhost; unsafe when exposed (see above).
- **Provider API keys are stored in plain text.** Keys live in `~/.loom/config.yaml`
  and, if you use Docker, optionally in `.env`. File permissions are the only
  protection. Keep `.env` private — it is git-ignored by default. OS-keychain /
  encrypted storage is not yet implemented.
- **LLM traces record message content.** The trace store (`/api/traces`, mirrored
  to `.loom/traces/`) records the messages and responses sent to providers so you
  can inspect raw calls. Provider keys are sent as HTTP headers and are **not**
  recorded in traces, but note content is — treat the trace store as sensitive.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Loom is an open beta maintained by a solo developer. If you find a security issue,
please open a GitHub issue describing it (omit any secrets), or contact the
maintainer directly. There is no formal SLA, but reports are appreciated and will
be addressed as the project moves toward 1.0.
